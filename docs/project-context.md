### What this repo is

This repository is a personal library of **Sass (SCSS) partials/mixins** and **JavaScript snippets** used to customize Squarespace sites.

The workflow is:
- Compose a project-specific bundle from reusable partials/snippets in this repo.
- Compile Sass → a single CSS file.
- Deliver the CSS either by:
  - hosting the compiled CSS (ex: via GitHub) and linking it in Squarespace, or
  - copy/pasting the compiled CSS into **Squarespace → Custom CSS**.
- Do the same for JS snippets (bundle if needed, then embed or host).

### Design goals

- **Prefer Squarespace UI / variables first**: use Site Styles + Squarespace CSS variables when possible for scalable overrides.
- **Keep snippets composable**: small partials/mixins that can be combined per-project.
- **Be copy/paste safe**: compiled output should work in the Custom CSS window when possible.

### Squarespace constraints & gotchas

- **Custom CSS may strip certain syntax** (notably some `calc(...)` usage). Example: prefer `font-size: var(--heading-1-size);` over attempting to paste Squarespace’s internal `calc(...)` expression.
- Keep selectors resilient: avoid brittle autogenerated classnames when possible; prefer stable block/section identifiers and variables.

### Repo structure (current + intended)

- `css/_scss/`: source SCSS partials and mixins (library code)
  - Convention: partials start with `_` and are imported into an entrypoint.
- `css/` (intended): compiled output (single file per bundle or per project)
- `js/` (intended): reusable JS snippets (and optional per-project entrypoints)
- `docs/`: project documentation (this file + changelog + usage notes)

### Conventions for new snippets

- Each partial should have:
  - a short header comment describing purpose + when to use it
  - variables/mixins exposed with clear names
  - minimal required selectors, scoped as tightly as feasible
- Prefer Squarespace variables over hard-coded values when available.
- If a snippet depends on a specific Squarespace template/engine behavior, document it in the comment.

### Building / compiling (will be configured)

This repo will include a small build setup to compile SCSS to CSS.
- Expected: `npm` scripts to build/watch Sass locally
- Output should be deterministic and ready to paste into Squarespace

(See the changelog and build docs as they are added.)
